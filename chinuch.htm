</div><br /><div><b>Prayer (Positive Commandment 5)</b><br /><br />

Parents are obligated to pray on their children for their success in body and soul. The matter of praying for children and their religious education is so important, that there is a place to think that prayer is the most important part of the parent's religious education (of them). It is a mistake to think that the religious education and growing of children to become great in Bible study and in character traits is in the hands of man; the matter depends on G-d. Rabbeinu Yonah writes that when women go to church, they should give charity and pray for their children because their petitionary prayers are most accepted then. Someone once asked the Stiepler Rav regarding a remedy for successful child-raising. He replied, <quote>"Psalms with tears"</quote> [referring to the oral tradition's explanation of Ex. 2:6 that tears automatically unlock all gates through which prayers must ascend]. When the man told the Rav that he could pray and even fast but he does not have the ability to cry, the Stiepler answered, <quote>"If you cannot cry, then your wife has to cry. Someone has to cry!"</quote><br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Studying and Teaching Law (Positive Commandment 11)</b><br /><br />

The most important commandment, <quote>"You shall love the L-rd your God..."</quote> is immediately followed by an explanation of what it means: <quote>"You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul... teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up."</quote><br /><br />

At times parental pressures may cause a shift in the child's behavior. An example of this is when parents try to force a certain type of education on their child. If they missed opportunities to be greater as a child, they feel that they have a second chance with their children. Usually, the oldest child becomes the victim of an inundation of education, with high expectations. Sometimes it could be just pressure in the home where the child is overwhelmed with too much homework and household help, and has no free time for himself. Or the parents try to make their children <quote>"carbon copies"</quote> of themselves. In these instances parents are violating the time-old dictum of <quote>"educate the child according to his way, not the parents' way"</quote>. The ABCs of education is for parents to recognize their child's individuality and capabilities, then to pair him with the right education. This principle also applies to recognizing the child's maturity level. Sometimes parents become impatient with their progress and will start to train him in various behaviors and character attributes, such as cleanliness or sitting long at the dinner table, before the child is ready.<br /><br />

Parents should also realize that sometimes the cause of the child's problem is something that is disturbing him. It could be a difficulty with a classmate or teacher he is not getting along with or the lack of proper friends. Each of these can affect the child emotionally, and because he lacks the ability or cannot find the right person with whom to discuss his problems, he will become frustrated and release his tensions and anxieties on others.<br /><br />

At times the teacher can assist the parent in working through problem behaviors (and feeling like the parents are allied with the teacher can also make the teacher less adversarial toward the child and give the child special attention).<br /><br />

Our lives are hectic from morning to night. More people than ever before are suffering from anxiety and other emotional problems (the biggest-selling drugs today are tranquilizers and anti-depressants), and there are more problems in family relationships than in previous generations. Moreover, the overabundance of tapes, CDs, books, lessons and therapists for every relationship and personal issue isn't stemming the tide. On the contrary, the problems seem to be getting worse. The previous generations had much less conveniences and had very little guidance and literature on relationship and personal issues. But despite the lack of availability of these things, people were more mentally stable, had fewer emotional problems and much more family harmony. The irony is that the opposite should be true. With our relatively easy lives and vast amount of material addressing most problems, we should be the ones with a more relaxed and peaceful life, while the previous generation should have been plagued with the problems we have today. As with all of life's problems, the Bible provides us with an explanation of this phenomenon in our society: Confusion, lack of patience and focus, and emotional unrest is one of the punishments that will befall the us when we fail to keep the Bible [Lev. 26:16]. Even when a person is sitting idly, his mind is not at rest, with his thoughts constantly moving. Our lack of inner tranquility is a punishment--measure for measure--for having lost the patience to serve G-d properly. Failing to take the time or to have patience for studying the Bible and doing commandments, results in being punished with physical and mental unrest.<br /><br />

Teaching children to live by Biblical morality without following it ourselves will be viewed by Heaven as hypocritical and stir up accusations against us. When our children (in their own studies) discover ways we're be being hypocritical, it will jade them and erode our credibility. When we fail to warn them against transgression (whether out of ignorance or apathy), they will feel (subconsciously, on a spiritual level) like we don't care whether they fall into sin, and are being hypocritical by transgressing Negative Commandment 299 (Misleading Advice). For example, when they waste food (or want more than they can handle), it's incumbent on us to remind them that Negative Commandment 57 (Wanton Destruction) not only forbids one from killing plants and insects (without a constructive purpose) and breaking their toys, but also forbids one from wasting (over an olive-sized amount of) food.<br /><br />

The Vilna Gaon, Even Shelema, Ch. 8: <quote>"Just like how an adult should learn an honest trade that's not too demanding, so too in religious education, a person should find a light learning program--that it should not be more than his capability and cause him to become disgusted by it--and that it be honest--that there should be no be impure intentions. So too with children, don't weigh on them; rather everything should be gentle, and you should give them small coins. Because learning only takes hold with calmness and composure. And they should learn first the whole Bible, that they should be familiar with it (i.e. the fundamentals, the foundation) almost by heart."</quote><br /><br />

If a child asks a question about faith, it must be addressed. If parents don't have the answer then they should do some research and speak with people who deal with these questions. If they don't, then the child will give up truthseeking or turn to other sources for the answer (and what are the chances he will get the proper answer from reliable sources)?<br /><br />

To waste time is considered nullification of this positive commandment (to study the Bible). One must at very least ensure that there is a time limit for computer/internet use so as not to lose time for important work or miss the time of prayers. It is important to set a spiritual direction for all computer/internet use, in order to avoid spiritual challenges, guide us away from the forbidden, and allow us to sanctify G-d's name in the world (which is the very purpose of existence). Avodah Zarah 18b equates wasting time with sitting in the company of mockers, based on Psalm 1:1-2: <quote>"Happy is the man who does not walk with the counsel of the wicked or stand on the way of sinners or sit in the company of mockers; but whose delight is in the law of the L-rd and who meditates on his law day and night"</quote>. Even if one were to disbelieve that wasting time is a nullification of this commandment, he could still weigh the opportunity cost of any given activity compared to whatever it is <i>he</i> considers G-d's highest priority (e.g. feeding the homeless, etc.). People often waste time because they think can't run at 100% efficiency, but this is a type of lacking faith (in heavenly assistance) and disregards that studying and meditating on the Bible is not wearying, but refreshing. <quote>"Your words [are sweet] to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth... Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."</quote> [Ps. 119:103,105]. <quote>"He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall trust: His Truth shall be your shield and buckler"</quote> [Ps. 91:4]. <quote>"Therefore men find refuge under the shadow of Thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of Thy House; and Thou shalt give them to drink from Thy river of delight. For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy Light shall we see light"</quote> [Ps. 36:8].<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Making Peace (Positive Commandment 190)</b><br /><br />

<quote>"[The Bible's] ways are pleasant ways, and all its paths are peace"</quote> [Pro. 3:17].<br /><br />

The standard parental reaction to the difficult or problematic child is usually to implement stricter discipline, which only proves to be counterproductive. Although they may experience a temporary improvement in their child, which stems from fear of the parents, it is highly doubtful that they will see any long-term results from tough discipline. The child will either put up an even stronger resistance or look for other ways to be mischievous. Forced discipline, using the standard methods of anger and severe punishing is not discipline and is one of the causes of rebellious teenagers today, when these methods are no longer applicable and the parents are left powerless. They may win the battle, even for a long period, but will eventually lose the war.<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Avoiding Disputes (Negative Commandment 85)</b><br /><br />

Sibling rivalry, possessiveness, and jealousy are indeed very normal. Intelligent parents will realize this and not expect their children to be completely righteous or perfectly in control of their emotions. They will do their utmost to avoid situations that would create conflict or rivalry among the children. They may have their favorite child, but they will be careful not to show it. (Chasam Sofer on Shabbos 10b writes that, in reality, Joseph was greater than his brothers and deserved the special treatment from Jacob. Nevertheless, the brothers did not appreciate his greatness, and the perceived unfairness eventually led to baseless hatred and their children becoming slaves in Egypt.) When children get out of hand, a parent should remember that children are children. Given time and a good education, they will be like good wine that improves with age, and they will give the parents a great deal of pride. Don't overreact!<br /><br />

When children quarrel, the first rule to follow is not to take sides. Even if the parent saw whom started first, nevertheless, it could be a reaction to something done previously that they did not see (e.g., he/she called me a name yesterday or took something of mine without permission). This could lead to a never-ending investigation of who incited the other first. A child who sees his parent side with his sibling will feel much resentment towards the parent for passing judgment without knowing all the details. A child will call for a parent's help to use his parent to carry out his own revenge. Parental intervention at this point is definitely counterproductive. Non-intervention will train the child to be on his own rather than to cry for help every time something is bothering him, a much needed trait for managing the child in school, where there are constant quarrels between students. Nevertheless, certain ground rules must be set, e.g., no violence or damaging of the other's possessions. Parents should also explain to quarreling children the severity of dispute, anger, hitting and other sins (revenge and bearing a grudge) that usually accompany quarrels, and the importance of peace and generously yielding, i.e. giving in for the sake of peace. Even though it may not stop the existing quarrel, it will leave an impression on them for the future.<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Rebuking (Positive Commandment 205)</b><br /><br />

I have witnessed in many homes parents constantly criticizing and correcting children (even the correct way) while hardly giving them praise, encouragement or support that they desperately need. This habit can easily create problem children and intensify an existing problem. (The righteous man never fills the role of the Accuser; rather, he must play both prosecution and defense and judge leaning toward the scale of merit. In being overly merciful, He affirms G-d's mastery of reality and trusts the Hand of Heaven to assist him in meting out justice measure-for-measure wherever <i>G-d</i> decides it's lacking.)<br /><br />

Parents must also know what, when, and where to show worry and concern when a child is not living up to their expectations. When a child feels that his parents are watching his every move, he will naturally become nervous, simply because he does not know what to expect from them if he makes even one mistake. This also occurs when the parents have high expectations of their child, thus putting children under more pressure.<br /><br />

"<quote>The words of the wise are heard when they are spoken gently</quote>" [Ecc. 9:17]. If adults are more open to accepting correction and criticism when not made defensive, then all the more so should children with their delicate makeup.<br /><br />

When parents lack the patience to invest their time and energy into positive parenting, their efforts will be diverted to negative parenting, such as constant criticizing and punishing. By the time a child isn't behaving, the root cause is long past and can't be band-aided this long after the fact. This results in the majority of their efforts being directed toward how to punish their children and applying the commonly used methods of anger, yelling, giving rebuke and moral exhortation to assert themselves. The common denominator among them is to assert authority and show the children who is really the boss. When a child is yelled at, he very often feels misunderstood because he has no chance to explain himself, and who knows what damage was done to his emotions and to the relationship with his parents as a result of this "shock". Moreover, yelling parents breed yelling children, as they will simply imitate their parents' behavior in self-defense, like an allergic reaction to a medication. Although force may be effective in winning the battle and getting the child to be obedient, parents will eventually lose the war and, Heaven forefend, the child as well. Not only are these methods Biblically prohibited, they are also one of the major causes for children going off the path; children who are constantly criticized and punished by their parents have a tendency to resist being educated from them.<br /><br />

Additionally, when parents criticize children (even constructively) for not acting properly or constantly complaining why they didn't get better grades in school without complimenting them on their accomplishments, the children will develop an aversion to activities and school because they associate them with criticism. Genuine "discipline" is positive parenting and how to apply its principles. Genuine education is training a child in the beauty and true values of living a life according to the Bible. A child who is constantly forced to act properly or fulfill Biblical duties will never learn to appreciate them, and may eventually end up rejecting these habits (especially when the child is older and these methods are no longer effective).<br /><br />

Being more forceful, reasoning that tougher discipline will be more effective, will only add oil to the fire and give the child more of a reason to disconnect from his parents. Or the reverse, parents will "throw in the towel" and ignore their children. A schoolmaster once remarked that when he was forced to expel boys because of misconduct, instead of being happy that they are now free to do as they wish, they had a feeling of resentment toward him because the school didn't care about them anymore and was casting them away to get lost in the world. Parents should realize that, whether consciously or subconsciously, children are looking for some type of direction in their lives. A child who senses that he is not receiving correct education from his parents will usually develop a subconscious enmity toward them, believing that they just don't care about him.<br /><br />

So how can parents control their words, especially when they're confronted at the end of a hectic day with disobedient children who refuse to finish their dinner and go to sleep on time? R. Chaim Friedlander offers the following story: A man who was suffering from various aches and pains went for a medical examination. He was diagnosed with high blood pressure, and the physician instructed that he must begin to exercise control over himself and not get annoyed or excited. The man replied that he was almost asking him to do the impossible, since his occupation is managing a large department store and bossing his workers or suppliers around is part of his job. The doctor replied, "<quote>Have it your way, but I cannot guarantee that you'll live another year if you don't learn to control yourself.</quote>" Faced with the choice of either death or self-control, he chose the latter. If people can exercise restraint to save their own lives, there is no reason why they can't do the same for their children's lives.    To prove that this motivation is within our reach, let's create an imaginary workshop: We'll offer each parent $50/day for not feeling annoyed with their children ($1,400/month!). It's time to leave the house and the children still haven't gotten dressed; the mother is about to scream at them for ignoring her instructions to get dressed, when a $50 note flashes in front of her eyes, reminding her of her workshop assignment. Gently, she approaches her children and, with a soft stroke on the cheek, reminds them how late it is and that they must hurry to be on time. During a meal, one of the children is playing at the table and accidentally tips over a jar of jam, shattering it to pieces and scattering the contents all over the freshly washed floor. The mother is ready to unleash her anger at the child, when the $50 note flashes in front of her eyes. Again, she calmly tells the child, "<quote>Don't worry about the mess, it will only take me a few minutes to wipe up. Just hurry and put your plate away.</quote>" The moral of this story is that we do have the ability to restrain and suppress our anger. It's merely a matter of motivation. In this experiment, the motivating factor was money. However, if parents would realize that, in any situation, keeping their calm greatly increases the quality and effectiveness of their education, and how vital it is for the child's emotional stability, they would spare no effort to perfect themselves in this area. In fact, parents don't realize just how damaging their rebuke can be. Once feigned annoyance accidentally becomes real annoyance and overcomes a person, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to suppress it before any damage is done.<br /><br />

Keep this thought in mind: Would any parent pretend to worship an idol to prove their point or discipline their child? Of course not! But remember, oral tradition says that one who gets angry is considered as if he worshiped idols (which is equivalent to breaking every commandment in the Bible, so how can one expect a child to accept the example being given as one worth following?).<br /><br />

As we say in the Passover Haggadah, "<quote>Our toiling in life should be directed toward raising our children.</quote>" Therefore, when parents see that their child-raising techniques are not effective, instead of losing their patience and seeking instant solutions that may further frustrate them, they should seek guidance from an Orthodox rabbi who is qualified in this field. The first step is to locate the source of the problem. Some common sources are poor role-modeling by the parents, low self-esteem, fears, problems at school or sibling rivalry. Troubles may also be caused by the influence of bad friends, exposure to the internet or secular books, magazines, or newspapers. Once the source of the problem is diagnosed, the parents can then start on the road to success.<br /><br />

A very important rule when punishing, disciplining or giving your child moral exhortation for misconduct is not to give a long sermon or speech. When a child is being chastised, his attention span is very short. After the first few moments, he is probably not even focusing on what is being said and is impatiently waiting for his parent to finish. In order to get a glimpse of the child's feelings, imagine yourself being reprimanded, rebuked, or corrected for something you did wrong. You'd want the rebuke to be as brief and to-the-point as possible so you could defend yourself (or carry on with your work). Sermonizing also can be counterproductive; if a child sees that reprimanding entails long and boring speeches, he will reflexively close his ears even before they begin. The result is that the child will absorb nothing. Also, moral exhortation or rebuke should not be given when the child is being punished. During that time, he is probably feeling dejected, and his mood and state of mind are at a low. The child is usually closed off from hearing anything, and talking to him is like talking to the wall. Parents should just concentrate on properly carrying out the punishment and save the moral exhortation as preventative medicine given at a time when the child is in a better mood and open to hear it.<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Loving Our Fellow (Positive Commandment 206)</b><br /><br />

A child who suddenly becomes troublesome at the dinner table or seems to always find a reason to quarrel or pick on a sibling could be suffering from a lack of attention. He reasons, "<quote>Stale bread is better than no bread.</quote>" Therefore, at least when he misbehaves, his parents know that he exists. If a child asks for too much attention, or seems to be overly whiny, it could be a sign that he's not receiving enough attention. When parents claim that they <i>do</i> give their children time and attention, I often advise them to re-assess what they are giving in order to ascertain if the child feels it. The value of attention and affection is measured by how the child receives it. Ten minutes of quality time could be worth an hour to the child, while one hour of non-quality time and non-focused attention is worth nothing to the child.<br /><br />

If there is a new child in the family, it usually brings with it a wave of jealousy, as the new baby is now the center of attention in the family. He is constantly tended to by his parents-cuddled, fed, changed, held when irritated and at times even merits to sleep with his mother. How then can we blame the older child for being jealous? A method worth trying to counteract this feeling of jealousy is termed as "<quote>identifying</quote>" with the infant. The child is asked to help the parents care for the newborn, e.g., changing diapers (nappies), holding, giving a bottle, wheeling the stroller (buggy), etc.  By identifying with the infant, the other child will also be giving the newborn attention and will become aware of the infant's needs for it. In addition, the mere fact of being "<quote>mommy's little helper</quote>" raises his self-esteem and gives him the attention that he needs.<br /><br />

The Neilah prayer (echoing Jer. 1:5) says: "<quote>Father knew You from youth.</quote>" Even though G-d's greatness is not dependent on anyone, no one recognized it before Father Abraham caused His name to be known. Therefore, he and his descendants (i.e. Israel, His firstborn) are entitled to G-d's kindness even after He became exalted and acclaimed throughout the world. A bechor (firstborn, chosen) feels he's entitled to this same elevated status (i.e. the bechorah, the birthright), because his father "<quote>possessed [him] at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old</quote>" [Pro. 8:22]. And there's legitimacy to this idea; mistakes with the eldest can cause their malaise to contagiously spread to the younger siblings, so it needs to be assessed whether younger siblings acting out has its root elsewhere. (Damaging the brain (whether the dominant or non-dominant hemisphere) paralyses the body, but so does damaging the spinal cord.) One can't expect the bechor to happily shoulder any unique responsibilities unless they're explicitly coupled to his unique status and its privileges. After all, who would sell their birthright (double-portion of the inheritance) just to get out of doing chores?<br /><br />

Parents should also be careful not to compare children. Usually in these situations, there exists one or more children in the family who seem to "<quote>raise themselves</quote>" with minimum difficulty. Thus when a child becomes difficult or is not living up to his parents' expectations, a parent may comment comparing their behavior to their sibling. Imagine how a father feels when his spouse asks "<quote>How come you can't learn or help me as much as my best friend's husband?</quote>" Just as these remarks give the spouse a feeling of rejection and dissatisfaction, all the more so with children.<br /><br />

Because we are always on the move, our large families, busy schedules, second jobs and responsibilities outside the home keep us on an emotional and physical marathon. Who has time to even stop and think? We are glad if we make it through the day without yelling at our children. As for giving our child attention and affection, we are just too busy! Can you imagine how a child feels when he observes a parent focusing on personal activities for half an hour non-stop, when he/she doesn't even have five minutes to focus on his needs? (How would you feel if your spouse acted the same way toward you?) A deprived child may seek negative attention, or take a more drastic step and seek approval from outside sources, namely other boys who are suffering from the same deprivation, who will replace his parents as chief influences.<br /><br />

We love it when our spouse takes a genuine interest in what we're doing, wants to discuss the topics we're interested in, or gives genuine compliments, so why wouldn't children? Children like to relate their stories about what transpired in school, whether in the class or about various activities of sports and games (e.g. who won or details about the game itself). Listening intently to him without interruption is often more important than talking. Parents should show empathy rather than curiosity about details. When a strong connection has been built, a child will want to run errands and go for walks just for the chance to get more of this quality time.<br /><br />

A properly conducted dinner table is a tremendous opportunity for building and strengthening family relationships through discussing the daily Bible readings (and their commentaries). "<quote>You shall teach these words of Mine to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house</quote>" [Deut 11:19]. However it also has its pitfalls which can be disastrous. Children are very anxious to relate their own stories and share their own ideas, but interrupting them, changing the topic, or shifting the center of attention to the spouse can cause the child to feel that he and his ideas are unworthy of being heard. Children should be given full attention at the dinner table.<br /><br />

If a child approaches the parents when they're pre-occupied with another matter, the parents should gently explain to him that they are presently unavailable, and do their utmost to return to the child at the first available opportunity. Even so, the child may lose his desire to speak or get involved with other matters and not return to the parents. Thus a golden opportunity to create the connection is lost forever. It is therefore of utmost importance for the parents to make every effort to prioritize their child when the child needs them. Parents should realize that if they have time to take a call from a friend, surf the internet, and handle all of their matters, but can't seem to find enough time to spend with their children, it is a clear indication that their children's needs do not rank high on their priority of values. If you spend less time than necessary with your child when he's young, you'll have to spend 10 times that amount of time when he's older with child psychologists, therapists, and social workers to get the child back on the right track.<br /><br />

There are three crucial times when expressing affection is most effective. A child who leaves the confines of his home needs to feel that his parents love him and are thinking of him, i.e. he is not alone when away from home (e.g. escorting their child out of the home, physically expressing affection, waiting until he goes on his school bus and waving goodbye). When the child returns, a warm greeting is of utmost importance to give the child the feeling that his parents missed him. The third crucial time for showing affection is when the child goes to sleep. Parents should tell inspiring bedtime stories about saints, as these engrave lasting impressions on the child (and vice-versa, stories that reflect secular philosophy can have a negative effect on children.)<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Lying (Negative Commandment 62)</b><br /><br />

When we encounter something that should provoke us to anger, we should instead react with immediate joy that we discovered the test before it could hurt us, and that G-d sought an excuse to do us good (rewarding us for something so trivial as surviving a cakewalk trial). But if we pretend to be angry, not only are we setting a bad example but it's considered lying. The few exceptions where lying is permissible are for the sake of peace; lying for the sake of disrupting peace is a perversion.<br /><br />

Mesilat Yesharim 11 rules that even lying as a joke is not permissible. That it disturbs the person and subtly humiliates them for their gullibility is covered below (Shaming, Negative Commandment 303). Society and its lies will teach our children that people aren't always serious, with or without our assistance shaping their cynicism.<br /><br />

If a child poses a question out of the bounds of what he should know, there are creative ways to tell the truth in a way that lends itself to misinterpretation, but lying erodes all a parent's credibility.<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Dispensing Proper Justice (Negative Commandment 273)</b><br /><br />

One of the unfortunate outcomes of difficult or problematic children is a feeling of distance from their parents. This could be caused by the child's feelings of frustration that his parents do not understand him or that they are too strict or being unfair with him. If this is not dealt with in its early stages, it can result in completely losing connection (political sway) with the child. If the child is resentful towards his parents, he will probably not take the initiative to rebuild his connection (emotional dependence). Therefore, the job of rebuilding the connection (political sway) rests with the parents, who are stronger and more capable of overpowering their own emotions and resentment towards the child. When there's a strong connection, children will listen and go to extremes not to anger their parents, so as not to endanger it. When such a relationship is developed, a mere look of dissatisfaction on the parent's face is usually enough to get the message across to the child. Fear of losing this connection is the only motivator that lasts into teenage years (and even adult life).<br /><br />

Regarding fairness: Job 11:12 compares children to a wild donkey; realize that children have a tendency to spill, forget, leave over food, be untidy, late, careless, uncooperative, lazy and grouchy. Remember, kids are kids, and don't expect them to be adults, even small ones. Parents must also set a "<quote>scale of values</quote>" that matches the Bible's values in their manner of reacting to a child's misconduct. For example, a child transgressing a non-Biblical or low-severity prohibition can trigger an almost immediate reaction from parents. However, when the child transgresses much more severe prohibitions and tells a lie or speaks evil of another, do the parents react the same way? Are they equally excited, gasping and exclaiming, "<quote>Shhh! That's badmouthing!</quote>" or "<quote>The Bible prohibits lying!</quote>" From observing their parents' reaction, a child gains a distorted view of the severity of sins (or his own G-d-given innate sense of justice will rebel altogether, crying out accusations against priorities that don't make sense).<br /><br />

Each parent must agree with their spouse's punishment or disciplinary action (this can be derived from Deut. 21:19). Even if a mother disciplines in a way that doesn't make sense, the father overturning her decision totally invalidates the mother's ability to punish. The child realizes that he can always "<quote>appeal his case</quote>" to his father in order to nullify his mother's authority. (Instead, the father must privately appeal an unjust punishment and the mother herself overturn it. Ideally, the parents should always confer before punishing so that the child realizes that both parents are always in agreement.)<br /><br />

It's important not to give a child a harsh punishment for only slightly misbehaving. For example, if a child returns 30 minutes late from playing with his friend and misses dinner, even if this is part of a larger pattern of the same behavior and there's a seeming need to finally put one's foot down, it would be an inappropriate punishment to deprive him of a family outing the following day. Instead, it would be more suitable to--measure for measure--deprive him of an hour of his playtime or to serve him a small substitute dinner. Instead of punishing or disciplining their child each time he misbehaves, parents will wait until it is convenient for them. By then, the child may have amassed so many misdeeds that he deserves quite a considerable number of punishments. The intention is to "<quote>settle their accounts</quote>" with the child. Even though all the punishments may be fair and administered calmly, the mere fact that they are meted out all at once will be so overwhelming to the child that he will think he is being punished unfairly. On the flip side is punishing or criticizing a child for every little mistake he makes. Parents must learn to look away and ignore small and seemingly insignificant things that their child does wrong (e.g. he used the cocoa spoon for the sugar, forgot to wipe his shoes upon entering the home, etc.). This type of parenting, which resembles more the job of a police inspector, will cause the child to be constantly nervous because of the parents' constant vigil. A child will hardly feel that his parents love him if he thinks that he's constantly scrutinized, attacked and punished for every little thing. (Think about it: Would you feel appreciated and liked by your boss if he stood over you and pointed out every little thing you did wrong?)<br /><br />

At times, parents act like pendulums. When they are in a good mood, they will smother their child with love and affection. However when they have a nervous or tense day, the child become a victim of his parents' anxiety when they unload their frustrations on him. As soon as the child returns home from school, they pick on him for any little wrongdoing. When the child is the recipient of this type of mixed behavior, he remains with the negative impressions of an angry parent who seemingly does not love his/her child. Why? 1) It's not so easy for us to just forgive and forget, all the more so with children. 2) The child constantly observes his parents and notices that they never lose themselves at other people in the manner that they react towards their child. Therefore, the child concludes that his parents are either angry at him, or have something against him. Either way he feels unloved, and children who don't feel loved become convinced that they are hated by their parents.<br /><br />

"<quote>One does not punish children for something that they will surely not do when they are older. Nor should one try to force them to do something that they will one day do automatically.</quote>" R. Yaakov once calmed down an enraged father who was yelling at his son for sitting in R. Yaakov's chair. R. Yaakov ensured the man, "<quote>He's only three. When he grows up, he won't sit in my seat.</quote>" Similarly, R. Yaakov stopped a father who was trying to force his young son to shake hands with him. "<quote>Why waste your energy on something that he will someday do gladly?</quote>"<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Shaming (Negative Commandment 303)</b><br /><br />

Name-calling of any kind, under any circumstances, often leaves scars and causes psychological problems. Imagine you're distracted by your small child who is doing something cute, forget that you are holding a full cup in your hand and brush against the table, spilling coffee all over the floor. How would you feel if your spouse's initial reaction would be to call you careless, sloppy, or point out your past history of similar mistakes? Will you not feel hurt? Is negative reinforcement really exactly what you need at that moment? Instead, you would probably go off defending your reputation from unacceptable negative reinforcement, totally distracted from actually learning from the acceptable kind (the humiliation of spilling coffee everywhere). "<quote>Do not rebuke a scoffer lest he hate you, but rebuking a wise man will cause him to love you</quote>" [Pro. 9:8] is referring to the same individual; addressing his evil side causes him to hate you rather than listen to your words, but telling him that you're surprised he's acting in a way not befitting of his wisdom is addressing his virtuous side. Only then will he will listen to you. Even if the parent uses the word "<quote>always</quote>" (e.g. "<quote>you always lie</quote>") each time the child lies, the child will eventually incorporate it into his self-narrative and think that he <i>is</i> a liar; as he gets older he will actually believe these "<quote>always</quote>" characteristics are part of his nature and that he was born with them.<br /><br />

One important factor to bear in mind while disciplining or punishing your child is to minimize embarrassing him. Hurting your neighbor's feelings, even in private, is a Biblical prohibition (ona'as devarim) [derived from Lev. 25:17 and Gen. 49:6], and when done in the presence of others, it becomes a more severe prohibition of public embarrassment. The Sages [in Bava Metzia 58b] say ona'as devarim is a more severe prohibition than ona'as mammon (cheating) because a person feels more distressed when his feelings are hurt, and money earned dishonestly can be returned whereas hurt feelings cannot be undone. At times, people tend to forget that this prohibition applies even to one's spouse and children. The Chazon Ish writes that this applies even if the other's feelings were only momentarily hurt, especially with children who may be easily distracted and then forget their previous distress. The Chafetz Chaim writes that this applies even when no one else is present, in the privacy of your home between husband & wife or parents & children. Hurting a child's feelings is even more stringent, since a child cannot (be "<quote>competent to</quote>") forgive until the age of majority. (Reish Lakish said, "<quote>The world exists only by virtue of the breath which comes from the mouths of school-children.</quote>" ("<quote>The kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.</quote>") Per Ex. 22:21, G-d will hear their cries of <i>any</i> unfortunate person and will respond personally with retribution to those who caused them pain, nevermind an innocent child when they cry out in their oppression.) While disciplining, parents should be careful not to do it in the presence of others (even siblings), which would transgress the additional prohibition of shaming another person in public (malbin pnei chaveiro be'rabim). The embarrassment causes the child unnecessary pain that is not at all related to the punishment. This painful feeling can cause the child to be totally turned off to accepting any rebuke, both now and in the future. It is prohibited to rebuke another person (even for the sake of a fulfilling a commandment) if it cannot be done without embarrassing, insulting or hurting his feelings [Erchin 16b]; R. Chaim Volozhin writes that someone who cannot rebuke gently without hurting the other's feelings is freed from the obligation to rebuke.<br /><br />

At times, when one hurts another's feelings, he will rationalize that the other person is too sensitive, needs to toughen up to handle the "<quote>real world</quote>", and should really not have been insulted by such an "<quote>innocent</quote>" remark. But an unintentional transgression is still a transgression. If you kill somebody unintentionally, all the excuses in the world won't bring them back to life; so it is when you kill somebody with words.<br /><br />

Another form of this prohibition is hurting another's feelings by making a negative remark about something the other person is invested in. Even if you are correct, not only are you prohibited from making a negative comment, you must also give compliments and say words of praise. Although this might seem to be untruthful, the Maharal explains that because the other person feels differently than you do about the thing (he finds the thing suitable for himself), complimenting is not considered lying, since it is true in his eyes [Kesubot 17a].<br /><br />

Another aspect of this principle is the prohibition of reminding the child of past misdeeds. When punishing or rebuking, some parents have a habit of mentioning to their child how many times he has previously misbehaved (when he's bound to associate past punishments with the current punishment on his own, without them needing to resurface publicly). This reaction is akin to the severe prohibition against reminding a repentant of his former non-religious ways. Therefore, once the child has received his punishment, parents should not remind him of it at a future time (especially if he apologized).<br /><br />

Another example of causing discomfort is when someone is eager to tell you a good tiding you have already heard. By letting him know that you are already aware of it you diminish his satisfaction. Rather, you should respond with joy as if you are hearing it for the first time.<br /><br />

If someone is suffering, it is prohibited to say "<quote>you deserve this for your previous sin.</quote>"<br /><br />

It is forbidden to embarrass someone by asking him a question that he cannot answer.<br /><br />

Scaring another person, such as hiding behind a door in a dark room and startling him when he enters is forbidden. This includes jokingly scaring someone by telling him false information, such as saying, "<quote>Someone stole your bike.</quote>" All forms of playing practical jokes on people are prohibited because they usually cause the recipient some type of pain or anguish.<br /><br />

People claim that it is difficult to smile after a long hard day of working, learning or tending to the children. However, we observe receptionists and waiters who always seem to give service with a smile because their jobs depend on it. Isn't the blossoming of household peace worth the ten-second effort of reacting to your family with only a happy expression? A person with a sad or angry expression is likened to one's liability for digging a pit in a public domain [Ex. 21:33]. Just as a pit causes people to stumble and fall into it, so does a person who projects an upset facial expression cause others to be (contagiously) upset. Even Shammai [known for his severe judgments] would say "<quote>Receive every man with a pleasant countenance</quote>" [Pirkei Avot 1:15].<br /><br />

One exception to this prohibition exists: When a child acts with arrogance by disobeying his parents in the presence of his siblings, it shows all the children that their parents' words mean nothing. If done exactly measure-for-measure, parents are allowed to rebuke this child publicly (to demonstrate the severity of arrogance). Even in these cases, parents should be extremely careful and not hasty, to make sure that the child was indeed acting out of arrogance; some children are too young to realize that their behavior was arrogant, and others may have learned this behavior from a friend.<br /><br />

It is not possible to list all the different categories of this prohibition (of causing hurt feelings); therefore, a person must refrain from saying or doing anything that even appears to be a violation, realizing that G-d knows his true intentions [Lev. 25:17]. When in doubt, one should think, "<quote>Would I want another person to say this to me?</quote>" according to the law "<quote>Do not do to another what is hateful to yourself.</quote>" Just as we are careful with what we put in our mouths insuring that the food has a proper hechsher, we must be equally careful what comes out of our mouths ("<quote>What comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.</quote>") "<quote>One can utter words that are like a piercing sword</quote>" [Pro. 12:18]. Before a person shoots, he is in complete control of the bullet. Once he shoots, he is no longer in control of it and will strike anything in its path. Likewise, before one speaks he is in control of his words. However once harmful words are uttered, they can do irreparable damage.<br /><br />

A man's wife served him burnt potatoes for supper. Instead of complaining, he told her "<quote>Oh, what a wonderful dish you've made tonight</quote>" His wife was so pleased that she made the same dish each evening for supper. Although he duly complimented her after each meal, it was becoming more and more difficult for him to eat burnt potatoes. When her husband saw that there was no way out of the dilemma that he had created for himself, he finally told her, "<quote>Let's try something new. One can get tired of anything.</quote>"<br /><br />


</div><br /><div><b>Feeling Annoyed (Negative Commandment 317)</b><br /><br />

"<quote>When G-d favors the actions of man, even his enemies will make peace with him</quote>" [Pro. 16:7]. From this the Sages derive through <i>argumentum a fortiori</i>: "<quote>If his enemies make peace, then all the moreso his wife and children!</quote>" and the principle that household peace rests entirely on the spiritual head of the household.<br /><br />

R. Avraham Azulai wrote that all the attributes of G-d are measure for measure, so in the way that one conducts himself with G-d, one's wife will conduct herself with him. This is what our Sages have said: 'If he merits, she helps him. If he doesn't merit, she is against him'--she rebels against him like he rebels against his Maker. Therefore, for every man whose wife doesn't listen to him, he should not complain against her, because he himself caused it. (However for the wicked, it is natural that their wives listen to them, because they are afraid of them.)<br /><br />

"<quote>Then Judah drew near to him [Yosef], and said, 'Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh' </quote>" [Gen. 44:18]. The Besht comments here that Judah, coming to the realization that G-d is present even in affliction, "<quote>drew near to Him.</quote>" He praised the Holy One. First, he said, "<quote>Bi Adoni (Oh my Lord)</quote>"--because all affliction derives from this name [Adonai being Malchut, representing the forces of concealment infused with strict judgment]. But when he drew near to Him and praised and exalted Him, the affliction was annulled [Yosef, the very source of their problem, revealed himself and showed his intentions as only for their good]. We have to learn from our negative inclination. Just as it is always alert to seduce us, so we have to always be alert to do G-d's will by refusing to fall for the trap. [Instead we must elevate the negativity to holiness by recognizing G-d's concealment in the test, indeed acknowledging that this is the purpose for its existence.] "<quote>In all their afflictions, <i>He</i> is afflicted</quote>" [Isa. 63:9].<br /><br />

The Besht continues with a parable: There was once a king who wanted to test the loyalty of his servants in all the distant lands of his reign. He sent a fleet of his ships across the ocean, bearing the flags of an enemy nation. When the fleet drew close to each port, it sent a message to the citizens of the town, "<quote>You have five days to surrender, or we will destroy you.</quote>" In every town there was panic. In some towns, the people prepared for war. "<quote>We are loyal citizens of the king, and we will fight for him to the death.</quote>" In other towns, they were ready to surrender, "<quote>The king is so far from here, he has nothing to do with our lives. Why should we die for him?</quote>" However, in one town, the people calmly replied, "<quote>This is a test! We love our king. He need not test us!</quote>" [The challenge of the battles represents the evil inclination in man, that seeks to seduce him to transgress G-d's will. Some people fight it, while others give in. In both cases, a test exists, because the individual forgets that the side of evil is also from G-d, and merely testing him. As soon as a person realizes that the tests is itself from G-d, and not something outside of Him, the test itself disappears, and one comes close to G-d again.]<br /><br />

"<quote>G-d is my light and salvation, who will I fear? G-d is the strength of my life from who will I dread? If an army arranges before me, my heart will not be afraid. If war is waged on me in this I will trust</quote>" [Ps. 27]. R. Avraham Yellin commented here, "<quote>In this</quote>" means in this itself, in the war itself that they wage against me, I trust that it is certainly for my benefit and that they are chasing after me only for my good. Similar to the sale of Yosef above. And this is a great advice to guard from anger when one is chasing after him that he should verbally say the verse: "<quote>If an army arranges before me, my heart will not be afraid. If war is waged on me in this I will trust</quote>" with the above intent, that this itself, the chasing, they are for my good and my salvation even in this world. And he should say several times with joy: "<quote>This person is chasing me. Certainly he is chasing me only for my benefit</quote>". And I have already seen wonders in this. Many times I did this, and immediately I saw that it was true, that the chasings were for my benefit became immediately evident. And the matter is as mentioned above. That according to one's level of faith will be the divine providence.<br /><br />

Chozeh of Lublin wrote that one should remember that everything is from the Creator, may He be blessed. As the Talmud says, 'A person does not knock his finger below unless it is decreed beforehand above', even from a human being with free will.<br /><br />

The Talmud says "<quote>whoever gets angry, it is known that his sins are greater than his merits</quote>" [Nedarim 22]. Midrash Pinchas adds that therefore, immediately when a person sees that he is starting to get angry, he should think in his heart, "<quote>since I am getting angry, then certainly it means my sins are greater. Therefore how could I have time to get angry? I must repent for my sins!</quote>" Then contemplate to repent, and immediately, he should be free from anger, since if he had (truly) repented, then his merits are greater, and necessarily he cannot be angry (since he who is angry, his sins are greater than his merits).<br /><br />

R. Eliyahu de Vidas wrote that if people insult you or do you bad, remember that this comes from the accusations that the Accuser [see Ex. 15:9] accuses on him above on his sins, and he should worry about them.<br /><br />

Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg tells a story about someone who would cause pain to a wise man. They said to the wise man: 'How great is the sin of this person who causes you pain for nothing!' The wise man answered them, 'I don't condemn him, rather my sins caused this.' They said, 'It's a commandment for you to punish him and curse him' He answered them, 'If so, I should punish and curse myself, because my sins caused me this pain'. Didn't Judah say 'G-d found the sin of your servant' [Gen. 44:16], which he meant 'I am certain that one of your servants placed the goblet in his bag, but our sins caused us to get this trouble.' And likewise when Shimi cursed David, David said: 'Let him curse, because G-d told him to curse, and my sins caused it. If I had not sinned, Amnon would not have raped Tamar, and Absalom would not have rebelled against me, therefore why should a living man complain?' [i.e. I should at least be thankful to G-d for being alive]<br /><br />

In the Tanya is written, the reason the Sages have said 'Whoever gets angry, it is as if he has worshiped idols' [Shabbat 105b] is as follows. At the time of his anger, the faith has left him, because if he believed what happened to him was from G-d, he would not have been angry at all. And even if a man, who has free will, curses him, hits him, or damages his property, and becomes lawfully obligated to him whether in worldly or heavenly courts, due to his bad choices, nevertheless on the person damaged, it has already been decreed above, and "<quote>there are many messengers to G-d.</quote>" And not only that, but even at that time when he is hitting or cursing him, the power of G-d wears him and the breath of His mouth gives him life and sustains his existence, as it is written by Shimi, when he cursed David, (David answered his men:) 'G-d told him to curse.' And when did G-d tell Shimi? Rather, the thought that fell into Shimi's heart and mind fell from G-d and the breath of His mouth which sustains existence of everything, sustained the spirit of Shimi at the time he spoke these words to David. Because if the His breath were removed from the spirit of Shimi he would not be able to speak anything. This is the meaning of 'G-d told him,' at that time literally, to curse David. And who is brazen enough to tell <i>Him</i> what to do...?<br /><br />

The Arizal wrote that from "<quote>the foundation of Fire</quote>" is drawn arrogance which is called "<quote>Inflated Spirit</quote>"--it being the lightest and highest of all the foundations. And included in it is anger, since it is because of arrogance that a man becomes angry when "<quote>his will is not being done.</quote>" And if he were truly "<quote>lowly of spirit</quote>", and he recognized his lacking, he would not at all become angry. And character attributes are a throne, and foundation, and root to the higher "<quote>intellectual soul</quote>". And through this, you will understand what our Sages have said "<quote>whoever gets angry it is as if he has worshiped idols</quote>" [Shabbat 105b]--literally, it weighs like all the 613 commandments [just as idol worship is considered to transgress all 613 simultaneously]. And likewise they said "<quote>whoever has arrogance it is as if he is a rejects the essence of the religion, and it is fitting to chop him down like an idol tree and his dust does not budge [in the resurrection]...</quote>" [Sotah 71], and many more like these. And understand this very well because in their being crucial and fundamental, they were not counted as part of the 613 commandments which depend on the "<quote>intellectual soul</quote>". Therefore we find that one should be more careful of bad character attributes than in fulfilling the positive and negative commandments. Elijah the prophet said "<quote>the Torah is not explained except to he who is not a impatient/irritable person, so too I will reveal myself only to one who is not such a person.</quote>" And likewise our Sages said "<quote>who is a person destined for life in the World to Come? Whoever is lowly and humble.</quote>" And many more. They did not mention the fulfillment of commandments but only good character attributes.]<br /><br />

R. Elazar ben Moshe Azikri wrote, is it conceivable that he who lost one flower, in his sadness and anger, should break something worth a thousand flowers?! [Which means he should think about the damage of his anger which is thousands of times greater than what he is bearing from the person (insulting him), and consider how it could ever be worth it. Just as G-d destroyed the Second Temple for the sin of baseless hatred, one invites destruction of his own temple (the body) by "</quote>tearing his [spiritual] garments in rage".]<br /><br />
